    //Explain the difference between `final` and `finally` in Java 8.

    /*
    "final" is used in class/method/variable to make it unchangeable.
    If a class is final, it can not be inherited by another Class.
    If a method is final, it can not be override in subclass.
    If a variable is final, it can not be assigned to another value.

    "finally" is generally used when dealing with exceptions.
    We can use try...catch...finally... to deal with exceptions.
    The statement in "finally" will always be executed.
